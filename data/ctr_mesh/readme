steps to construct control mesh

preproces step
- create a control mesh at 17 location along Victoria's body in Blender
- export control mesh and slice information (slice vertex indices, slice center, which will be the scale center of the slice. slice center must be the intersection between slice plane and skeleton, centroid doesn't work) 

control mesh construction step
- load control mesh and slice information
- arrange slice using height location of 2d slice
- scale slice along x, y using with and depth of 2d slice.
